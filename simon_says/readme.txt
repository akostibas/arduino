This was written to work with a Little Robot Friends
(http://littlerobotfriends.com) Arduino robot, though if you grab their
libraries you might be able to get it to work with other boards. Either that,
or port the few helper functions I use (the ones starting in `lrf.____`) to
your hardware.

You will also need the Timer library, available here:
